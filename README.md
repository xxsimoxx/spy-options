# Spy options

**Get a list of which plugin use which option and delete unused ones.**

This plugin catches other plugins adding/updating options and log options for each plugin.

**This plugin is not intended to run in production.**

When creating a new website, it is common to experiment with multiple plugins to achieve the desired functionality.
When the site is finished, this plugin helps to clean up the database from options that are no longer necessary, allowing you to delete all the options of one or more plugins.

This plugin is built for [ClassicPress](https://www.classicpress.net/).
